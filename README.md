This is the source code for Human Vocal Type Classification using MFCC and Convolutional Neural Network paper that can be read at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9568474. 
This repositori contains:
1. Augmentation Code (WavAugment)
2. MFCC + CNN Code (Main Code)
3. STFT + CNN Code (Comparator for MFCC)

For the note, this is the source code only, where the research emphasized on the dataset. The dataset can be requested at kriesnabyprtm@gmail.com on reasonable request.
